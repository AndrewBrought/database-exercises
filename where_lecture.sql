# # WHERE CLAUSE LECTURE
#
# # The Where clause allows us to craft queries based on very specific criteria
#
# # The following concepts will be covered:
# # LIKE
# # BETWEEN
# # IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
# # Comparison Operators
# # IN
# # DISTINCT
# # Chaining WHERE clauses
#
USE employees;
#
SHOW TABLES;
#

SELECT * FROM salaries;

# # example queries on the employees table
#
DESCRIBE employees;
#
#
# # Basic WHERE Clause
# # the list of employees that were hired in 1987-02-23
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date = '1987-02-23';
#
# # LIKE and wild cards
# # all the employees with a first name that starts with "F"
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'f%';
#
# # all the employees whose last name ends with ing
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '%ing';
#
# # all the employees with "in" somewhere in their first name
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%in%';
#
# # BETWEEN
# # all the employees that has an employee number between 12434 and 12440
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE emp_no BETWEEN 12434 AND 12440;
#
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE emp_no >= 12434 and emp_no <= 12440;

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1990-10-22' AND '1990-11-22';
#
# # IS NULL and IS NOT NULL
# USE codeup_test_db;
# SHOW TABLES;
# SELECT * FROM users;
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE role_id IS NULL;
USE employees;
#
# # IN
# # all employees with one of the following first names 'Elvis','Magy','Brendon'
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE first_name IN ('Elvis','Magy','Brendon');
#
# # same results different approach
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'Elvis'
                           OR first_name = 'Magy'
                           OR first_name = 'Brendon';
#
# # DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT DISTINCT first_name FROM employees;
SELECT DISTINCT last_name FROM employees;
# How many unique first name last name combinations
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name FROM employees;

# # Chained where clauses
#
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE emp_no = 10001
   OR first_name = 'Parto';

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE birth_date = '1953-09-02'

#
# Where we plave the parenthesis in where clause can effect outcome - we can add paranthesis to further clarify
SELECT *
